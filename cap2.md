**Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types in Python**

**Introduction**

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. Understanding variables and data types is crucial for storing and manipulating data effectively in your programs.

**Chapter Objectives**

  * Understand what variables are and how to use them.

  * Learn about the different data types in Python.

  * Perform basic operations with variables and data types.

**Variables in Python**

A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that can hold a value[cite: 290, 291, 292]. In Python, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=). For example:

```python
name = "John Doe"
age = 30
average_score = 85.5
```

**Data Types in Python**

Python provides various built-in data types to represent different kinds of data[cite: 290, 291, 292]. The most common ones include:

  * **String:** Used to represent text[cite: 292]. Example: `"Hello"`, `"Python"`.

  * **Integer:** Used to represent whole numbers. Example: `10`, `-5`, `1000`.

  * **Float:** Used to represent decimal numbers. Example: `3.14`, `2.71`, `9.99`.

  * **List:** Used to store a collection of items. Example: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`[cite: 292].

**Basic Operations**

  * **Concatenation:** Combining strings together[cite: 292].

    ```python
    first_name = "John"
    last_name = "Doe"
    full_name = first_name + " " + last_name 
    print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
    ```

  * **Accessing List Elements:** Accessing items in a list using their index (starting from 0)[cite: 292].

    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    first_fruit = fruits[0]  # Access the first element (apple)
    print(first_fruit)
    ```

**Practice Exercises**

1.  Given a list of numbers, find the sum and average[cite: 294].

2.  Create a program that takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Kelvin[cite: 295].

3.  Implement a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome[cite: 296].

4.  Create a function to reverse a given string[cite: 297].

5.  Given a list of names, concatenate them into a single string separated by spaces[cite: 297].

6.  Write a Python program to check if a given string is a pangram (contains all letters of the alphabet)[cite: 298].

7.  Calculate the area and circumference of a circle given its radius[cite: 299].

8.  Implement a program that converts a given number of minutes into hours and minutes[cite: 300].

9.  Create a function to count the number of vowels in a given string[cite: 301].

10. Write a program to check if a number is prime[cite: 302].

**Conclusion**

This chapter provided a comprehensive introduction to variables and data types in Python. You learned how to declare and use variables to store data, as well as the fundamental data types.  These concepts are building blocks for more complex programming tasks.
