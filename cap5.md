**Chapter 5: String Operations in Python**

**Introduction**

This chapter explores string operations in Python, focusing on manipulating and formatting text data. Strings are a fundamental data type, and proficiency in string operations is essential for various programming tasks.

**Chapter Objectives**

* Understand common string operations such as concatenation, slicing, and searching.
   
* Learn how to format strings using different methods.
   
* Apply string operations to solve text-based problems.

**String Operations**

Python provides a rich set of built-in string operations:

* **Concatenation:** Combining strings using the `+` operator.
   
    ```python
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "World"
    result = str1 + " " + str2  # Output: Hello World
    ```
    
* **Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a string using indexing and slicing.
   
    ```python
    text = "Python"
    substring = text[1:4]  # Output: yth
    ```
    
* **Finding:** Locating substrings within a string using the `find()` or `index()` methods.
   
* **Replacing:** Substituting parts of a string with the `replace()` method.
   
* **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of a string (e.g., `upper()`, `lower()`, `capitalize()`).

**String Formatting**

String formatting allows you to embed variables or values within strings.

* **f-strings:** (Formatted string literals) A concise way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`.
   
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
    ```
    
* **`format()` method:** A versatile way to format strings using placeholders.

**Practice Exercises**

1.  Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. [cite: 58]
   
2.  Write a function to count the number of vowels in a given string. [cite: 59]
   
3.  Given a list of words, concatenate them into a single string separated by spaces. [cite: 61]
   
4.  Create a function to reverse a given string. [cite: 61]
   
5.  Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in it. [cite: 61]
   
6.  Implement a function that checks if a given string is a pangram (contains all letters of the alphabet). [cite: 61]
   
7.  Given a string, write a function to remove all vowels from it and return the modified string. [cite: 61]
   
8.  Write a Python program to find the length of the longest word in a sentence. [cite: 61]
   
9.  Create a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the sentence in reverse order. [cite: 61, 62]
   
10. Given a list of names, count the number of names that start with a vowel. [cite: 62]
   
11. Write a function to remove all duplicate characters from a given string. [cite: 62]
   
12. Implement a program that takes a sentence and a word as input and checks if the word is present in the sentence. [cite: 62]
