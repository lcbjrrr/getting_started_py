 
**Chapter 6: Lists and Tuples in Python**

**Introduction**

This chapter introduces two fundamental data structures in Python: lists and tuples. Lists and tuples are used to store collections of items. Understanding their properties and operations is crucial for efficient data management.

**Chapter Objectives**

* Understand the difference between lists and tuples.
   
* Learn how to create, access, modify, and manipulate lists.
   
* Learn how to create and access elements in tuples.
   
* Explore common operations and methods associated with lists and tuples.

**Lists**

A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. Lists are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets `[]`.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**List Operations**

* **Accessing Elements:** Accessing list items using their index (starting from 0).
   
    ```python
    first_fruit = fruits[0]  # "apple"
    ```
    
* **Modifying Elements:** Changing the value of a list item.
   
    ```python
    fruits[1] = "orange"  # fruits is now ["apple", "orange", "cherry"]
    ```
    
* **Adding Elements:** Adding items to a list (`append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`).
   
* **Removing Elements:** Removing items from a list (`remove()`, `pop()`, `del`).
   
* **Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a list.
   
    ```python
    sub_list = numbers[1:4]  # [2, 3, 4]
    ```
    

**Tuples**

A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items. Tuples are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses `()`.

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

**Tuple Operations**

* **Accessing Elements:** Accessing tuple items using their index (similar to lists).
   
    ```python
    first_color = colors[0]  # "red"
    ```
    

* **Immutability:** Tuples cannot be modified after creation. You cannot add, remove, or change elements in a tuple.

**Key Differences**

* **Mutability:** Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.
   
* **Syntax:** Lists use square brackets `[]`, and tuples use parentheses `()`.
   
* **Use Cases:** Lists are used when you need a collection of items that can be changed, while tuples are used for collections that should remain constant.

**Practice Exercises**

1.  Given two lists of numbers, concatenate them into a single list.
   
2.  Write a program that finds the largest and smallest elements in a list.
   
3.  Implement a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the squared values.
   
4.  Create a program that finds the common elements between two lists and stores them in a new list.
   
5.  Given a list of words, find the word with the maximum length and its length.
   
6.  Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each element in a given list.
   
7.  Given a list of names, remove all duplicate names and print the unique names.
   
8.  Create a function that takes a list of strings and returns the list sorted by the length of the strings.
   
9.  Write a program that checks if a given list is sorted in ascending order.
   
10. Implement a function that takes two lists and returns their union (all unique elements from both lists).
