**Chapter 1: Getting Started with Python**

**Introduction**

Welcome to the first step of your Python journey! This chapter is designed to get you acquainted with the Python programming language and set up your development environment. By the end of this chapter, you'll be ready to write and run basic Python programs.

**Chapter Objectives**

* Understand the basics of Python programming.
   
* Set up a Python development environment.
   
* Write and execute simple Python programs.

**Setting Up Your Environment**

To start programming in Python, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website ([https://www.python.org/doc/](https://www.python.org/doc/)). [cite: 4]

In addition to Python, having a good code editor can make your programming experience smoother. There are many options available, from simple text editors to more advanced Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

**Your First Python Program**

Let's write the traditional first program: "Hello, World!". In Python, it's a simple one-line command:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This line tells Python to print the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. [cite: 5]

**Basic Python Operations**

Python can perform calculations. For example, to calculate the sum of two numbers:

```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum)
```

**Practice Exercises**

To solidify your understanding, try these exercises:

1.  Write a Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. [cite: 8]
   
2.  Create a program that takes a user's name and age as input and prints a greeting message. [cite: 9]
   
3.  Write a program to check if a number is even or odd. [cite: 10]
   
4.  Given a list of numbers, find the maximum and minimum values. [cite: 11]
   
5.  Create a Python function to check if a given string is a palindrome. [cite: 12]
   
6.  Calculate the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and time period. [cite: 13]
   
7.  Write a program that converts a given number of days into years, weeks, and days. [cite: 14]
   
8.  Given a list of integers, find the sum of all positive numbers. [cite: 15]
   
9.  Create a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in it. [cite: 16]
   
10. Implement a program that swaps the values of two variables. [cite: 17]
