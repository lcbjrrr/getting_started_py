**Introduction**

This chapter introduces NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy provides powerful tools for working with arrays, performing mathematical operations, and handling large datasets efficiently.

**Chapter Objectives**

* Understand the basics of NumPy arrays.
   
* Learn how to create NumPy arrays from Python lists.
   
* Learn how to perform basic array operations.
   
* Learn how to generate arrays with random numbers.
   
* Learn how to calculate statistical measures using NumPy.
   
* Learn how to reshape arrays.

**NumPy Arrays**

* **NumPy Array:** A fundamental data structure in NumPy. It's a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. [cite: 102]
   
* **Creating Arrays:** NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists using the `numpy.array()` function. [cite: 102]
   
* **Array Operations:** NumPy allows you to perform element-wise operations on arrays, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. [cite: 102]

**Generating and Manipulating Arrays**

* **Random Number Generation:** NumPy can generate arrays filled with random numbers. [cite: 102]
   
* **Statistical Measures:** NumPy provides functions to calculate statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation. [cite: 102]
   
* **Reshaping Arrays:** The shape of a NumPy array can be changed using the `reshape()` method. [cite: 102]

**Practice Exercises**

1.  Given a list of numbers, create a NumPy array and find the sum and product of its elements. [cite: 103]
   
2.  Implement a program that generates a NumPy array with numbers from 0 to 9 and reshapes it into a 3x3 matrix. [cite: 103]
   
3.  Write a Python program that uses NumPy to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset. [cite: 103]
   
4.  Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the NumPy array sorted in ascending order. [cite: 103]
   
5.  Given a list of lists, create a 2D NumPy array and find the sum of elements in each row and column. [cite: 103, 104]
   
6.  Implement a program that generates a random NumPy array and finds the maximum and minimum values. [cite: 104]
   
7.  Write a function that takes a NumPy array and returns a new array with all elements squared. [cite: 104]
   
8.  Given a NumPy array, calculate the dot product of the array with itself. [cite: 104]
   
9.  Create a program that uses NumPy to calculate the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. [cite: 104]
   
10. Implement a function that takes a NumPy array and returns the transpose of the array. [cite: 104]
